1. [Oh my git!](https://ohmygit.org/). Open source, graphical git game with commit graph visualization. Much better than the Git Interactive Exercises provided on 4Geeks.
2. [git-demo-parent](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-git-demo-parent). The GitHub repository we made and contributed to during the in-class demo.

Here are some of the resources about optimizers and gradient decent we looked at in class

1. [2024 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/popular-information/). Hinton's contribution was work on *backpropagation* - a gradient estimation method that allowed neural networks to be trained (both the 'popular' and 'advanced' information tabs on this page are highly worth a read).
2. [Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980). The scientific paper describing the popular and widely used ADAM optimizer. **Highly** technical/theoretical & extremely dense. Don't expect to fully understand this one - but it's interesting/fun to look at (Note the year and the first author's affiliation).

Here are the links to the official documentation pages for Pandas and Matplotlib:

1. [Pandas - Python Data Analysis Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2. [Matplotlib â€” Visualization with Python](https://matplotlib.org/)
