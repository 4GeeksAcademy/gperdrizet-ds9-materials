SciPy's implementation of the statistical tests for tonight's hypothesis testing exercises:

1. [T-test](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.ttest_ind.html)
2. [ANOVA (also called the F-test)](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy/reference/generated/scipy.stats.f_oneway.html)

Three great sources of information about any package or library we use in Python are: GitHub, PyPI, and the library documentation. Here are two example libraries we will use a lot:

### SciPy

Core scientific/technical computing utilities in Python. Was originally written as a standardized set of numerical operation on top of the then new 'numeric array data structure' (which later became NumPy) in 2001.

1. [SciPy GitHub Repo](https://github.com/scipy/scipy)
2. [SciPy PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/scipy/)
3. [Official SciPy documentation](https://docs.scipy.org/doc/scipy-1.15.0/index.html)

### SciKit-Learn

'SciKit' originally meant 'SciPy ToolKit' i.e. an extension to the SciPy library. Focused on machine learning and data science. Was originally written around 2010 as part of Google Summer of Code.

1. [SciKit-Learn GitHub Repo](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn)
2. [SciKit-Learn PyPI page](https://pypi.org/project/scikit-learn/)
3. [Official SciKit-Learn documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)

1. [Oh my git!](https://ohmygit.org/). Open source, graphical git game with commit graph visualization. Much better than the Git Interactive Exercises provided on 4Geeks.
2. [git-demo-parent](https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/gperdrizet-git-demo-parent). The GitHub repository we made and contributed to during the in-class demo.

Here are some of the resources about optimizers and gradient decent we looked at in class:

1. [2024 Nobel Prize in Physics](https://www.nobelprize.org/prizes/physics/2024/popular-information/). Hinton's contribution was work on *backpropagation* - a gradient estimation method that allowed neural networks to be trained (both the 'popular' and 'advanced' information tabs on this page are highly worth a read).
2. [Adam: A Method for Stochastic Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6980). The scientific paper describing the popular and widely used ADAM optimizer. **Highly** technical/theoretical & extremely dense. Don't expect to fully understand this one - but it's interesting/fun to look at (Note the year and the first author's affiliation).

Here are the links to the official documentation pages for Pandas and Matplotlib:

1. [Pandas - Python Data Analysis Library](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
2. [Matplotlib â€” Visualization with Python](https://matplotlib.org/)
